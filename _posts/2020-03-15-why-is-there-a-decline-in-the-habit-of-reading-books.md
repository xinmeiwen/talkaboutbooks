The modern generation has achieved many **valuable** things as compared to their previous generations like,

* Wealth (more salary, more options)
* Comfort ( things like Air Conditioners, Fridge, Car etc.)
* Freedom (Choosing their government, spouse, profession etc.)
* Faster Communication (Mobile phones, Internets cars etc.)
* Knowledge and information (Internet, Social media)

However, the modern generation has also lost couple of things which are **invaluable** in life, like,

* Time
* Relationship
* Patience
* Wisdom
* Conscience

**People today are so much focused on worldly things of life that they have lost touch with their soul.**

**They to everything which can make their wealthy, powerful and successful in the eyes of the world rather than doing something that can provide them inner satisfaction, inner growth and joy.**

* Reading books needs lots of time which people hardly have today.
* Understanding books needs lots of patience, which is a rare commodity today.
* Following the knowledge contained in the books to make your life better needs wisdom, which is rarely found in people now.

**People are happy to acquire knowledge from the social media platforms which are written by people who have tons of information, but possess no experience of life.**

**They have no time, patience and ability to learn from books written by great authors of the world who actually know what life is because they have spend their life understanding the complexity of the world and share their deep wisdom through their writings.**
